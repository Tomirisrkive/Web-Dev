If the team rules forbid the use of one-letter and vague names – shorten them, make abbreviations.

Like this:

list → lst.
userAgent → ua.
browser → brsr.
…etc
Only the one with truly good intuition will be able to understand such names. Try to shorten everything. Only a worthy person should be able to uphold the development of your code

Add a new variable only when absolutely necessary.

Instead, reuse existing names. Just write new values into them.

In a function try to use only variables passed as parameters.

That would make it really hard to identify what’s exactly in the variable now. And also where it comes from. The purpose is to develop the intuition and memory of a person reading the code. A person with weak intuition would have to analyze the code line-by-line and track the changes through every code branch.

An advanced variant of the approach is to covertly (!) replace the value with something alike in the middle of a loop or a function.

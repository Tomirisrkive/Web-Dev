<!--
What’s the benefit of using Symbol("id") over a string "id"?

As user objects belong to another codebase, it’s unsafe to add fields to them, since we might affect pre-defined behavior in that other codebase. However, symbols cannot be accessed accidentally. The third-party code won’t be aware of newly defined symbols, so it’s safe to add symbols to the user objects.

Also, imagine that another script wants to have its own identifier inside user, for its own purposes.

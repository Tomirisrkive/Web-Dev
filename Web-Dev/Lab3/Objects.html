<!--
Objects are associative arrays with several special features.

They store properties (key-value pairs), where:

Property keys must be strings or symbols (usually strings).
Values can be of any type.
To access a property, we can use:

The dot notation: obj.property.
Square brackets notation obj["property"]. Square brackets allow taking the key from a variable, like obj[varWithKey].
Additional operators:

To delete a property: delete obj.prop.
To check if a property with the given key exists: "key" in obj.
To iterate over an object: for (let key in obj) loop.

The base can vary from 2 to 36. By default, it’s 10.

Common use cases for this are:

base=16 is used for hex colors, character encodings etc, digits can be 0..9 or A..F.

base=2 is mostly for debugging bitwise operations, digits can be 0 or 1.

base=36 is the maximum, digits can be 0..9 or A..Z. The whole Latin alphabet is used to represent a number.
